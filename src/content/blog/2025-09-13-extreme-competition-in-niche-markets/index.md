A user posted about seeing a local coffee shop operating their own "bot farm" in order to "amplify their message" and boost engagement via Instagram:

This really highlights exactly how *secretly competitive* some local businesses can be. I don't know if I'm possibly just naive in this regard, but I'd never think about my cute little locally owned and operated coffee shop running bot farms for engagement, buying likes, review bombing competitors, or using any other of the "guerilla marketing tactics". Technically it's against ToS of most platforms, but the standard punishment doesn't normally stop the "crime" from occurring in the first place.

I wanted to dive into these and see exactly how they worked, as I'm clueless to things like:
- How much does this cost?
- What are all the benefits?
- Weekly time investment?
- How normalized is it?
- Pros and cons? Any chance for law blowback?

I'm (of course) familiar with the scraping / automation issues surrounding bots. Detection checks on things like mouse movement, screen size, user agent, IP address, account activity, account creation date, etc.

And of the best ways to do this, with things like Python / JS and Playwright. My main questions come in surrounding the usage of the actual hardware and its setup. Like... 
- Why? 
- What are they running on them to automate it, and what exactly are they automating? 
- What's the bare-minimum level of "botting" that you need in order to gain a leg up on your competition?
- Can it be utilized in other ways to skew data, like with Google / Apple maps to show increased activity (no idea if this affects anything ðŸ˜‚)
