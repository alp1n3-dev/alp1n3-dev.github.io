## Places to Self Publish

- [Amazon Kindle Direct](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/)
- [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com)
- Polar.sh
- [Draft2Digital](https://www.draft2digital.com)

## Book to Read About the Process

Then read "Let's Get Digital" by [David Gaughran](https://davidgaughran.com/books/lets-get-digital-how-to-self-publish/).

## Book Formatting

- Typst (will make it easier to deal with styling + page breaks)
- Markdown

I'd recommend writing it in markdown, because it's easy. Then when ready to publish transform it into a Typst document and add in formatting, themes, etc. Both also support syntax highlighting.

## Publishers to Look At

- No Starch Press
- O'Reilly
- Wiley
- Manning
- Macmillan
- McGraw Hill
- Packt
