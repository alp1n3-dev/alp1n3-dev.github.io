## slow-roll your posts

Start pushing chapters and seeing if people are interested by just doing the normal thing; blogging. Establish a routine and push your blog posts out, self distribute them through various sites and feeds (POSSE), and if they are an article with merit (not just a small link blog post), submit them to news sites / more official publications. If several posts within a certain niche are pulling in a good amount of interest, maybe try to pitch a book about that niche or begin organizing chapters and self-publishing them a little bit at a time! **It's a marathon, not a sprint.**
