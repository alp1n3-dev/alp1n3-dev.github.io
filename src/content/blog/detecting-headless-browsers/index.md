## what's wrong with a headless browser?

They eat up your bandwidth and sanity... essentially. Costing you money from pulling potentially intensive pages that involve certain functions, stealing bandwidth from your real visitors, potentially stealing the content on your site, and hitting pages over and over again for no good reason. A headless browser usually indicates some type of bot, crawler, or scraper, and there's not really a great reason you'd want to allow them on your site, especially if you don't care about SEO.

Goal: Weed out the bottom 80%. Ofc it's just a game of cat-and-mouse past that point and there will always be new ways to evade detections, but killing off that many is still a win.

## chrome
