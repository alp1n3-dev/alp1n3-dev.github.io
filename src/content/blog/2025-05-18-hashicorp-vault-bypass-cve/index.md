**GitHub Advisory:** [Here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f9ch-h8j7-8jwg).

I thought this CVE highlights why deeply knowing the tech you're testing matters. Someone unfamiliar with Azure authentication could have easily overlooked this, or it could have even been missed if third-party authentication was ruled as as out-of-scope for testing.
