## warning - just use JetBrains Rider

Learn the CLI for the `dotnet` tooling, but just stick with an "official" C# / ASP IDE. It's not worth it to fight with the C# Dev Kit constantly crashing / bugging out. Anytime anything (even small) goes wrong, say goodbye to intellisense / other features. Not going to say I've never had any qualms with Go tooling, but I've used it in Zed, VSCode, Helix, and never had any issues with intellisense crashing.

Or, you could use Visual Studio. But I'm tinfoil hatting here and feel like Microsoft intentionally made C# Dev Kit terrible to use in order to promote Visual Studio use... which is almost definitely not true... but still.
