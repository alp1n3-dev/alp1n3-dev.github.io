**What is a hyperstructure?**

From the popular blog post by

For web2, the hyperstructures of the internet aren't the companies packaging together OSS tech and selling it to you as a SaaS, it's the OSS tech itself. OSS tech dies out all the time for a myriad of reasons though:

- infighting
- lack of funding
- lack of contribution
- and tons of other reasons

Self-sustaining OSS projects are a gem, and I think the future revolves around free-for-personal use licensing for a lot of them, while relying on corps to foot the bill to keep the lights on ðŸ’¡. Ofc there are exceptions to this recommendation, but that's where small-bill software and lifetime licenses come in (I think).

An amazing screenshot software for $30 that will _most likely_ work for 3+ years? Perfect! A diagramming software with a one-time purchase of $10? Great as well! Or a personal firewall utility that only costs $2 a month? Another phenomenal option.
