In the Fedora [project discussion](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/fedora-moves-towards-forgejo/139114/9) it looks like they're [moving forward](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-chooses-forgejo/) with [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) as their new forge. Forgejo is a fork of Gitea and is **dead easy** to host, especially with Docker.

> The Fedora Council is pleased to announce that we have chosen Forgejo as the replacement for our git forge! That means youâ€™ll see Forgejo powering our package sources (src.fedoraproject.org) as well as our general git forge (what pagure.io is today). It has been a long road to get here, and we cannot thank the Fedora community enough for your patience and support throughout.

I've personally never used a different forge than GitHub, setting it up and checking the UI and options out was a great experience as it is extremely intuitive to use and doesn't hog too much of the system's resources (_running in Docker on an M1 MacBook Air_). You can find the documentation link in its repo on [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo), and the install instructions boil down to:

```bash
docker pull codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:10
```

Make sure to choose SQLite unless you have a db ready to go! It's written in Go too, which is pretty cool -- I've spent some time going through the code and it's been a great learning opportunity.
