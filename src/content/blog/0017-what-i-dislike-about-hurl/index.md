While I was testing benchmarks for my `net/http` wrapper I thought I'd see how it currently compares to similar tools, so one of the tools I put it up against was the `cURL` wrapper Hurl.

Let me say right off the bat, I **love** Hurl and it's what inspired me to start this educational project using `Go` and wrapping functionalities from `net/http` and creating some of my own additions, customizations, and opinionated syntax.
