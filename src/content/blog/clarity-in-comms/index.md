## text-based chat is a powerful when used right

Text chat is amazing when used right. It creates an entirely verifiable history of every situation and is indexable for future cases. In some corps it can become a problem if it's not being used right though, and I still hear about people struggling these days with async communication methods, so I figured a little write-up of some of my personal rules could potentially help others out there.

## keep it short & simple, but clear and professional

A general overarching rule is being respectful of other's time (also ref. the golden rule too), and part of that is getting to the point while including the relevant information needed. Don't draw conversations out for no reason, and don't wait for others to ask questions to provide specific answers you already have that are probably relevant.

It's also a good general rule to be nice and professional no matter what method of communication you're using, whether its internal or external. "But I like to get straight to the point" -- this can still be done without being rude or obtuse.

## it creates a timeline

Proof is a great thing to have (just in case), but it's also handy for after-action items if things need to be reviewed. The speed of delivery, the proof that an item was requested or delivered at a specific time, are helpful to everyone. No portion of any internal transactions should be obfuscated, it should all be as transparent as possible. This goes hand-in-hand with disabling message deletion / editing after a reasonable cap like 5-10 minutes.

## don't use reactions for passing information or responding

Reactions can be handy for "in-between" communication, but if they're attempted to be used a response things can start falling apart quickly. No one should have to decipher the emoji reactions they're receiving to their messages, and in terms of notifications an emoji doesn't mean anything.

```md
Bob reacted to your message with :thumbs-up-otter:
```

The above notification means nothing. What message is he reacting to? What does an otter with a thumbs up have to do with it?

An "in-between" communication is one where a response in text is eventually required, but you're acknowledging something in the meantime. Like if a message tells you to correct a deliverable, you might react with "ðŸ‘€" to let them know you've seen it and are doing it right now. Eventually, you'll follow up with a response that it's fixed, not another emoji reaction.

## threads or message groups for deep dives



## announcements only in announcement channels

It just has to be said. Some corps will have 15+ channels you'll be in where callouts may be utilized liberally, depending on the company. Announcement-only channels that are restricted to only specific people posting enable the employees to leave that channel fully 100% un-muted to ensure they never miss an announcement.

## email is a final resort for internal comms

It's clunky, it's gross, and the corp is probably using Outlook. The pro is it's essentially universal and not a walled garden like Slack / Teams so it enables cross-corp communication.

The really handy part is that it gives you an outline of what's needed from who right off the bat without needing to explicitly say so. If you're CC'd, your attention is needed to read it, but probably not respond. If it's to you, your attention is **required**, and you **most likely** need to respond. EZPZ.

Email is where internal comms go to die though, as it feels much slower and less cooperative, and you'd normally only see it occurring between two *insanely* silo'd teams at the same corp.

## reference the topic directly w/ words + visually

When shooting a message about a specific project, repo, etc. be sure to reference what you're talking about directly in writing. Like:

```md
Alice: Hey! I've run into an issue with the function "getScript" on line 245 of the "Web Scraper 2077" project.
```

When referencing the topic your own personal flare can be thrown in. I like to do brackets, but other ways might be to use bolded text or double quotes. It doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't just blend in with the rest of a potentially long message. I find this useful when talking about multiple different problems with one person as it makes it easier to mistake one problem being assigned to something else entirely.

## make use of embedded urls

Very similar to the previous section, but in a different way. This highlights the text with link styling and also allows the receiver fast access to exactly what you're talking about.

## when asking a question remember: time is money

Asking for help is always a potentially vulnerable time, you're admitting you don't fully know something and need assistance.

Since you're asking a coworker for their help, be cognizant of the time it takes for them to switch tasks and assist you. Be prepared for them and provide all the detail up front. Don't be the person who slides into their inbox with a "Hi!" and leaves it at that. Also, **try** to avoid back-2-back messages for help to the same person if possible.

Some examples of items to include:

- The link or reference to what you're stuck on.
- The things you've tried to fix the problem.
- What you think may be the issue, but that you aren't sure on how to approach it.
- Any extra contextual details and links that may help.

Show that you've put effort into attempting to fix the issue and that you didn't give up 5 minutes into the task just to take time away from the work they're responsible for.

Avoid being branded a [time predator](https://www.seangoedecke.com/predators/).

## double check

Before sending that message, just ensure it's spelled correctly, makes sense, and that the links / references are to the intended pages.
