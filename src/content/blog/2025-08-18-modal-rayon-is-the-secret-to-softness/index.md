I was in Dick's Sporting Goods the other day looking at their clearance items with my girlfriend when she spotted some nicely colored women's activewear from a brand called "Calia". She summoned me over to one of their hoodies and had me feel it -- it was both cooling and insanely soft. It inspired me to search the store for a men's jacket of the same material, but my search came up empty. The softest interiors for the mens hoodies were usually a fleece or poly combo, and Calia doesn't make men's clothing. When I got home, the search was on.
