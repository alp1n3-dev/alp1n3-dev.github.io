There's a ton of link-aggregator GitHub `README.md` lists out there containing insane amounts of *basically* useless information that is aggregated for the sake of aggregation. It's akin to digital hoarding (don't look at my read later app though ðŸ˜’). 

**So instead, here's a collection of basic software and tools for the everyday dev or power user**. I'll try to list alternatives in two categories: 

1. SaaS (might cost money, hosted on other's servers)
2. Self-Hosted (aka essentially free)

In some cases there might be more than two listed, just because the alternative offering is *very different*.
