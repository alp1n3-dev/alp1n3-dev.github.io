## there's a ton of wordlists & payloads

And a lot of them overlap. Here I'm collecting some of the most useful / condensed / community-supported ones in an effort to "tune-out" the noise. Over time my goal is to *hopefully* have a more condensed source of truth that relies on less wordlists and separate tooling, as a lot of the time their maintenance can fall by the wayside (especially when Python is involved ðŸ˜‚).

## scanning rules

There's a lot less of these, but I figured it couldn't hurt to have the links handy. Ideally, anyone creating these and publishing them to their own repos should also have pushed these to the official community repos (if they exist), but that doesn't always happen.
