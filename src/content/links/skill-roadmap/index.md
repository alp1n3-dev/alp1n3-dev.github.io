Need help or running into a problem? Use the GitHub Security Lab's [Discussions](https://github.com/github/securitylab/discussions). Sometimes updates to CodeQL contain breaking changes (like to the dataflow API) and the relevant documentation for specific languages isn't updated, so don't be afraid to ask.
