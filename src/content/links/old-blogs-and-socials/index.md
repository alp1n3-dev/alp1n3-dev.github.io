I've jumped around a lot in terms of blogging platforms. The places I've spent the largest amount of time were WordPress, SubStack, and Paragraph.xyz. Learning of the recent issues surrounding SubStack, I thought it was about time to get my own domain and just utilize GitHub Pages for my "new" blog.

Normally I'd move all my posts over, but during some of the transitions portions of their formatting have been tweaked to the point where going back and fixing each one just isn't really worth it. If you'd like to give any of them a read, be my guest:

- [alp1n3 SubStack]()
- [alp1n3 Paragraph.xyz]()
- [Ashpool SubStack]()
- [BlackPanel SubStack]()

Just as a heads-up though, essentially all of them are first drafts, and date back to when I was in college... so the accuracy on some of them may be "iffy". Most posts are me exploring a specific topic to learn more about it, and the medium of blogging lends itself to deeper learning.

In terms of social media, I don't have a ton anymore. The international embrace of short-form content was a net-negative for my time and presence in the day-to-day. I can be found sporadically in different text-based platforms though, and my primary ones are:

- [Signal]()
- [GitHub]()
- [BlueSky]()

If you need to get a hold of me for any reason, any of these works, but you'd have the best luck with Signal or BlueSky. You can also find me lurking in the OWASP Slack, PortSwigger Discord, and PentesterLab Discord.
