Throughout my time online I've seen a bunch of what I'd consider "cool" companies. They could fit into a number of different categories:

- cool policies
- cool people working there
- doing cool work
- cool ui for their site

*You get the gist of it.*

So I thought I'd point out a few of them, and what I like. If any company is left off of this list, it's not because I don't think they're cool, these are just point-in-time collections, and a lot of them also revolve around UI or bootstrapping specifically.

## MacPaw & Moonlock

A great [company](https://macpaw.com) that's produced very clean and useful Mac apps for a long time and also happens to have a super-sick [malware analysis](https://moonlock.com) team that is focused on Apple-OSes. 
## Good Enough

[They](https://goodenough.us) build [Jelly](https://letsjelly.com), an email collaboration tool that I'd be enthused to have a reason to try out some day.
