  This is a collection of work & experiments in the cybersecurity field.
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated from <b class="text-blue-500"><TextLink href="https://dsu.edu">Dakota State University</TextLink></b> with a MS in <b>Cyber Defense</b> and a BS in <b>Cyber Operations</b>.

    Since then I've worked as a <b>Malware Analyst</b> with <b class="text-blue-500">Army Cyber Command</b>, and am now a <b>Web Application Security Consultant</b>.

    <p>
    I'm a big fan of open security standards for applications and workflow automation when it comes to security testing. The easier it is to identify and replicate, the more secure everyone's apps can be üòÅ! My writings and other projects are scattered across the web, but if you feel like it you can find some of them listed in the <b>links</b> page.
